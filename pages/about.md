## About the Project

The “What Happens After Disaster Documenting the Impacts of Hurricanes in Southwest Florida” digital exhibit was created as part of HIS 3080: Archiving History to practice with processing materials and culminate with creating a digital exhibit. This exhibit explores how hurricanes have shaped the region’s past and continue to influence its identity. This project brings together a collection of primary sources that document the environmental, social, and infrastructural impacts of major storms, particularly Hurricane Donna in 1960, across Collier and Lee Counties.
Drawing from materials donated by the Collier County Museums, this exhibit integrates damage assessments, health bulletins, images, and newspaper coverage that provide a look at how communities endured and recovered from natural disasters. These objects not only record destruction but also reveal the resilience of Southwest Florida’s residents as they navigated the aftermath of catastrophic weather events.

## Purpose and Goals
The goal of this project is to preserve and document evidence of hurricane impacts in a way that connects past experiences to the present. By digitizing these items, the exhibit makes the historical record of storms that profoundly shaped the region’s development, public policy, and community life more accessible.
Students in HIS 3080 approached the project with an emphasis on archival practice and digital preservation. We focused on how to organize, preserve, describe, and interpret historical materials in a digital environment. Each item in this exhibit has been carefully cataloged with metadata following archival standards to ensure long-term accessibility.

## Featured Items
The exhibit features a range of materials that capture different perspectives on the hurricanes’ effects including the following
- Hurricane Donna Damage Report. This is a detailed account of the widespread damage left in Donna’s wake across Collier County.
- Collier County Hurricane Information. This is a record of hurricanes that affected the region over decades, this report puts Hurricane Donna in context with earlier and later storms.
- Florida Health Notes. This volume by the Florida State Board of Health provides a unique look at the public health impacts following the storm.
- Fort Myers News-Press Issues. These newspaper reports document how local residents and officials prepared for and responded to Hurricane Donna.
These items together offer a record of both official and personal experiences, reflecting how local institutions and individuals confronted the challenges.

## Broader Significance
This project shows the importance of digital archiving in preserving local histories that might otherwise be lost to time. By collecting and digitizing reports, images, newspapers, and health documents, this exhibit ensures that these vital records remain accessible to future researchers, educators, and residents seeking to understand Southwest Florida’s past in regard to Hurricanes.
The exhibit demonstrates how digital humanities and historical research can come together to preserve community memory. It reminds us that while hurricanes have repeatedly tested the region, they have also inspired remarkable stories of endurance and collective strength.

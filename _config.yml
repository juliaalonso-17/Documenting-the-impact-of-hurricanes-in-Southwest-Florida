description: "This exhibit documents the lasting impacts of hurricanes on communities in Southwest Florida, mainly across Collier and Lee Counties. Drawing from object donated from the Collier County Museums, this collection features images, reports, health notes, and newspaper issues detailing the events, damage, and personal impacts from hurricanes, such as Hurricane Donna in 1960, that shaped the region’s history.Items include damage assessments, public health analyses, images of coastal areas and storm surge, and firsthand journalistic accounts that reveal both the devastation and resilience of Southwest Florida residents. Through these primary sources that range from official state publications to local news coverage, the repository preserves a vital record of environmental, social, and infrastructural change. Together, these materials provide insight into how natural disasters influenced regional development, public policy, and community recovery efforts, ensuring that the story of hurricanes in Southwest Florida remains accessible for researchers, educators, and the public."
